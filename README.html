<h1>PTS Assessments</h1>


<h2>Mobility Assessment</h2>

<p>The Mobility Assessment is designed to be taken <strong>after it has been established a patient is eligible for transport</strong>. The user is to follow the questions, entering yes/no answers where required or entering the patient's weight. When one of the supported Equipments or Requirements is deemed necessary for the patient, it will light up on the left hand side of the page - this will also be noted again when a mobility is suggested.</p>

<p>When the user first uses the page they will see an 'Enable Cookies' button on the left side of the page. Clicking this will allow the user to restore any previous answers by pressing the 'Restore' button. When cookies are enabled the page will automatically save the answers if the 'Restart' button is pressed, when the 'OK' button is pressed after a mobility has been suggested, or when the user changes to another assessment. It is recommended that all users enable cookies for their convenience.</p>

<p>Once the user has completed enough questions for the assessment to decide which mobility would be most appropriate, this mobility will be displayed to the user. Alongside the mobility the user will be shown any equipment, requirements or journey notes which should be transferred into Cleric. Clicking the 'OK' button at the bottom of the window will restart the assessment, and pressing 'Return' will hide the suggestion and allow the user to change any answers if necessary.</p>


<h2>Mental Health Assessment</h2>

<p>The Mental Health Assessment is a copy of the current assessment hosted on Google Docs. It is designed to be more responsive than the current assessment, but all questions and responses are identical.</p>

<p>The Mental Health Assessment does not support saving and restoring answers at this time.</p>
